# dotfiles-etc

Some dotfiles and similar files that I want to keep the track of.

## C++ 

After many experiments and tries to find up the best cross-platform
independent C++ development environment that would suit me, I have
ended up with qtcreator and emacs. In both cases I have setup GNU
coding styles, namely the indenting. It is my personal choice and I do
not want to argue about other alternatives (I like VS Code quite a
lot, but still it is not my choice). Dot.emacs is the first file I
have uploaded into this repository, some more may follow or may not.

These are nothing but simple notes and comments for myself and hardly
be useful for anyone else.
